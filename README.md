### Project Overview: ft_transcendence

The **ft_transcendence** project involves developing a fully functional **real-time Pong contest website** with advanced gameplay features and strict compliance with security and development standards. This project challenges developers to create a single-page application (SPA) with both basic and advanced functionalities, allowing players to compete in live Pong games and tournaments. Here's a summary of the core requirements and modules:

---

### Core Requirements

#### Minimal Technical Requirements:
1. **Frontend**:
   - Must use **pure vanilla JavaScript** unless overridden by a module.
   - Should be a **single-page application** with browser Back/Forward button support.
   - Must function seamlessly on the latest version of **Google Chrome**.

2. **Backend**:
   - Optional; if implemented, must be written in **Django framwork**.
   - Should adhere to database constraints if a database is used.

3. **Game Features**:
   - Enable **live Pong games** with two players using the same keyboard.
   - Include a **tournament system** with player matchmaking and alias registration.

4. **Security**:
   - Passwords must be securely hashed.
   - Protect against **SQL injection** and **XSS** attacks.
   - Use **HTTPS (WSS for WebSocket)** connections.
   - Validate all forms and user inputs.

5. **Containerization**:
   - The project must run in an autonomous **Docker container** with a single command (`docker-compose up --build`).

6. **Error Handling**:
   - The website should have **no unhandled errors or warnings** during use.

### Modules for Additional Features

To achieve full project completion (100%), developers must implement **at least 7 major modules**. Examples include:

1. **Web Development**:
   - Backend framework  Django.
   - Frontend  Pure vannila js ,using bostrap.

2. **Gameplay Enhancements**:
   - Support for **remote players** .
   - New games with history and matchmaking.

3. **User Management**:
   - Standard user authentication and tournament management.
   - Remote authentication and JWT-based access.

6. **DevOps**:
   - Microservices architecture for the backend.

7. **Accessibility & Compatibility**:
   - Support for multiple devices, and browsers.
   - Accessibility options for visually impaired users.

### Summary
This project provides an opportunity to explore the **full-stack development process**, focusing on real-time features, containerization, and secure coding practices. While the basic implementation ensures a functional Pong contest website, the modular approach allows for innovative enhancements such as AI opponents, remote gameplay, and blockchain integration.
